# Superior Pristine Cleaning Company Frontend

This repo holds the server code for the admin of SPCC.

I built this site for a client who needed a better way to manager her cleaning business.

This backend was built with Node.js and Express.js

A normal user can visit the live version at: https://superiorpristinecleaningcompany.netlify.app/.

To access the admin panel, you can go to: https://superiorpristinecleaningcompany.netlify.app/admin.

Use the following credentials to mess around with the app:

email: admin@gmail.com
password: 123456

## Installation

After you have cloned this repo, in your cli run: 

```bash
npm i && npm start
live-server
```

This will start up the server locally!

## Usage

I made this app for the client because they needed something more efficient than their standard client management.
